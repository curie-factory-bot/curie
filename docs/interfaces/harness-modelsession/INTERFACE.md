**Kind legend:** CLEAN = a real `Protocol`/typed port class · SOFT = swap via env/URL/prefix/wire, no code interface · NONE = not built yet.

## The black line

Inside the runner the model harness is reached through one in-process port: the
`ModelSession` Protocol. Everything above it (ACI translation, budget, side-effect
flagging, NDJSON, the HTTP layer) is written against the Protocol. The port itself is
CLEAN, but the SDK is not yet confined to one module: fifteen runner modules still import
`claude_agent_sdk` today (`check.py`, `session.py`, `hooks.py`, `adapter.py`, `mcp_argv.py`, `fake.py`,
`approval.py`, `translate.py`, `plugin.py`, `state.py`, `progress.py`, `issue_read.py`, `usage_report.py`, `tool_access.py`, `__main__.py`, whose boot path
assembles the approval gate's `PreToolUse` hook matcher alongside the bundle's), and the
value that crosses the port is currently the raw SDK message union rather than a
runner-owned neutral type. The
runner-owned `TurnEvent` model that was once going to draw that line is withdrawn, not
pending: issue #307 is closed as superseded and its PR #315 was closed unmerged (the
withdrawal of OpenCode-as-second-harness, recorded in ADR-0060/0061), and no `TurnEvent`
type exists anywhere in the tree.
ADR-0061 (Draft) replaces it with an out-of-process harness boundary, tracked by open
#844; until something lands, a second harness must emit objects the SDK-shaped
translation step accepts. What stays opinionated core is the frozen ACI wire contract the runner
serves; the port is how a harness plugs into that runner. Steer and interrupt are
first-class Protocol operations, not emulated.

## Current contract

A second harness must supply an object satisfying `ModelSession`
(`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::ModelSession`), a five-method `Protocol`:

- `async def connect(self) -> None` (`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::ModelSession.connect`) — start/attach the harness,
  rehydrating if a resume ref is configured.
- `async def query(self, text: str) -> None` (`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::ModelSession.query`) — push a user message;
  a `query` issued while a turn is live is the mid-run **steer**.
- `def receive_turn(self) -> AsyncIterator[Any]` (`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::ModelSession.receive_turn`) — yield the harness
  messages for the current turn and, optionally, the runner-internal payload-free
  `PartialMessageBoundary` (`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::PartialMessageBoundary`)
  and `StreamedToolUseBoundary`
  (`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::StreamedToolUseBoundary`), ending at the
  terminal result. Both boundaries are telemetry yields, not `translate_message` input.
- `async def interrupt(self) -> None` (`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::ModelSession.interrupt`) — native hard stop at the next
  safe boundary.
- `async def close(self) -> None` (`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::ModelSession.close`) — tear down.

Optional capabilities sit beside the five-method port. A session may implement
`McpServerReconnector.ensure_mcp_server`
(`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::McpServerReconnector.ensure_mcp_server`) so the runner
can verify and repair the session's own MCP connection before clearing a connector failure.
A harness that omits it keeps side-probe-only connector recovery. A session may also expose
the duck-typed `export_replay_state` hook. It returns `HarnessReplayState` for a full
checkpoint or delta, or `None` when there is nothing new to export
(`runner/src/curie_runner/history.py::HarnessReplayState`), and `SessionRunner` bounds the export to
`_HISTORY_REPLAY_EXPORT_BUDGET_SECONDS` (five seconds) before preserving portable replay
without the harness checkpoint (`runner/src/curie_runner/session.py::SessionRunner`).

Apart from `PartialMessageBoundary` and `StreamedToolUseBoundary`, the values a `receive_turn` iterator yields must be
mappable by `translate_message` (`runner/src/curie_runner/translate.py::translate_message`)
into the ACI outbound union (`TextDelta` / `ToolNote` / `SideEffectFlag` / `ErrorEvent` /
`Final`). `SessionRunner` consumes those internal boundaries only as telemetry evidence; they
never reach `translate_message` or the ACI stream. Today the translatable messages are
the concrete `claude_agent_sdk` dataclasses, and the neutral `TurnEvent` payload that was
to decouple the port from the SDK shape was withdrawn with #307/#315 rather than shipped.
Session options are assembled by `build_options`
(`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::build_options`). Since #245 / ADR-0010 the permission
posture is conditional, not pinned: with an approval `can_use_tool` callback the session
runs in `permission_mode="default"` so each tool call is gated, and only an unconfigured
agent (no callback) keeps the historical `"bypassPermissions"` verbatim
(`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::build_options`).

The Protocol is only half of what a second harness owes the runner. Since ADR-0060
(Accepted) a harness is also a **declared package**: it ships a `HarnessContribution`
manifest (`runner/src/curie_runner/harness/contribution.py::HarnessContribution`) naming
its image, install packages, accepted credential shapes, read-only tool set,
model-override env keys, spawn-env builder and bundle compiler, and it registers a
`get_contribution` callable under the `curie.harness` entry-point group
(`runner/src/curie_runner/harness/registry.py::ENTRY_POINT_GROUP`, declared for the
built-in in `runner/pyproject.toml`). Discovery is fail-closed: a flat module path, a
key already claimed by a built-in or by an earlier contribution, or a non-`str` key is
refused rather than resolved by scan order
(`runner/src/curie_runner/harness/registry.py::discover_contributions`). The runner
selects one at boot from `CURIE_HARNESS`
(`runner/src/curie_runner/config.py::RunnerConfig.from_env`, surfaced as
`runner/src/curie_runner/config.py::RunnerConfig.harness`) and resolves it through
`runner/src/curie_runner/__main__.py::_resolve_harness`, which short-circuits built-in
names to a direct import so a broken sibling entry point cannot brick the default, and
otherwise goes through `runner/src/curie_runner/harness/registry.py::resolve_harness`
and fails loud on an unregistered name.

## Implementations today

Two, both in `runner/src/curie_runner/`:

- **Real:** `ClaudeAgentSession` (`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::ClaudeAgentSession`), wrapping `ClaudeSDKClient` in
  streaming-input mode. Its `receive_turn` normalization iterator wraps
  `self._client.receive_response()`: it converts only allowlisted partial-message starts
  into payload-free `PartialMessageBoundary` values, converts an allowlisted
  `content_block_start` tool_use into a payload-free `StreamedToolUseBoundary`,
  discards other SDK `StreamEvent` payloads, and otherwise yields the SDK messages.
  `interrupt` delegates to
  `self._client.interrupt()` (`runner/src/curie_runner/adapter.py::ClaudeAgentSession.interrupt`).
- **Fake:** `FakeModelSession` (`runner/src/curie_runner/fake.py::FakeModelSession`), a scripted
  replayer that constructs real SDK message dataclasses. It does not emit
  `StreamedToolUseBoundary`. It is the reusable acceptance
  harness: `conformance_producer` (`runner/src/curie_runner/conformance.py::conformance_producer`) drives
  a real `SessionRunner` over the fake (`runner/src/curie_runner/conformance.py::_build_runner`), so the ACI conformance gate
  validates the actual translation/final plumbing, not a canned stream.

At the package layer there is exactly one registered contribution, the built-in Claude
harness (`runner/src/curie_runner/harness/claude.py::CLAUDE_CONTRIBUTION`), which
declares no new behavior and only names what `sdk_auth.py`, `side_effects.py` and
`plugin.py` already did. So the registry is a guarded indirection around this same
adapter until a second contribution exists to teach it.

## Known leakage

The port is CLEAN as a code interface but leaks harness shape where the SDK is not yet
walled off, called out in vision-doc Job 1:

- **SDK-shaped message payload.** The value crossing the port is the concrete
  `claude_agent_sdk` message union, and `claude_agent_sdk` is imported across fifteen
  runner modules rather than one harness package. The runner-owned `TurnEvent` model that
  was to draw the neutral line is withdrawn (issue #307 closed as superseded, its PR #315
  closed unmerged and kept only as mining material for the package-shaped redesign);
  ADR-0061 (Draft) puts the boundary out of process instead, and
  confining these imports into the Claude harness package is part of open #844. ADR-0062
  (Accepted) already gates the boundaries that are clean with import-linter contracts in
  `pyproject.toml`, but its full ban on importing the SDK outside the Claude harness
  package cannot be turned on until that refactor lands. Until then a second harness
  emits SDK-shaped dataclasses that `translate_message` understands.
- **Plugin-format entanglement, now visible in the manifest.** `packages/plugin-format`
  is the Claude Code plugin shape verbatim, so a non-Claude harness must interpret Claude
  Code plugin bundles or translate them; "implement the ACI server" understates that work.
  ADR-0060's manifest names that cost rather than removing it: `compile_bundle` returns a
  `runner/src/curie_runner/harness/contribution.py::BundleCompileResult` whose `plugins`
  field is typed `list[Any]` and, for the built-in, is filled with the SDK's own
  `SdkPluginConfig` objects (`runner/src/curie_runner/plugin.py::load_plugins`).
- **Duck-typed replay export.** `export_replay_state` is discovered with `getattr` in
  `runner/src/curie_runner/session.py::SessionRunner`, unlike the declared
  `McpServerReconnector` optional protocol. A second harness can therefore miss a
  load-bearing checkpoint capability without a protocol conformance failure.

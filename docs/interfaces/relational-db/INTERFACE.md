**Kind legend:** CLEAN = a real `Protocol`/typed port class · SOFT = swap via env/URL/prefix/wire, no code interface · NONE = not built yet.

## The black line

App state (agents, versions, deployments) lives in a Postgres database, reached
through SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) with Alembic migrations. The swappable thing is the
**Postgres instance behind the DSN** — compose Postgres, RDS, Cloud SQL, any managed
Postgres — while the SQL/ORM layer and the `curie` schema stay opinionated core.
This is a deliberately un-abstracted seam: a managed-Postgres swap is a **DSN change**
(`DATABASE_URL`), not a code change. There is no repository/DAL port; SQLAlchemy 2.0 +
Alembic *is* the contract for the API, while the worker reaches the same schema through
hand-written SQL over its own engine (reads and writes), so the schema itself (table
and column names included) is the real coupling. A narrower port would be extracted
only if a non-Postgres store is ever demanded.

## Current contract

A second implementation must be PostgreSQL 15 or newer, speaking the async `asyncpg`
dialect and honoring the models/migrations verbatim. Compose and the chart ship
PostgreSQL 16:

- **DSN + schema** (`apps/api/src/curie_api/db.py::SCHEMA`, `apps/api/src/curie_api/db.py::create_engine`): `SCHEMA = get_settings().db_schema` (default `"curie"`, `apps/api/src/curie_api/config.py::Settings`); the engine is built from `database_url` (env `DATABASE_URL`) via `create_async_engine(..., pool_pre_ping=True)`.
- **Schema-scoped metadata** (`apps/api/src/curie_api/db.py::Base`): `Base.metadata = MetaData(schema=SCHEMA)` — every table is qualified into the `curie` schema.
- **Models** (`apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py`): every `Base` subclass in that module is `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::Agent` (table `agents`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::AgentChannel` (table `agent_channels`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::AgentVersion` (table `agent_versions`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::Deployment` (table `deployments`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::ThreadWorkspace` (table `thread_workspaces`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::Approval` (table `approvals`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::ThreadPublicationLineage` (table `thread_publication_lineages`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::PublicationReviewReservation` (table `publication_review_reservations`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::GitHubReviewDelivery` (table `github_review_deliveries`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::GitHubReviewFeedback` (table `github_review_feedback`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::Publication` (table `publications`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::CredentialRedemptionAuditEntry` (table `credential_redemption_audit_entries`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::ApprovalAuditEntry` (table `approval_audit_entries`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::AgentAction` (table `agent_actions`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::ActionAuditEntry` (table `action_audit_entries`), `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::WorkflowStateEntry` (table `workflow_state_entries`), and `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::ConsoleSession` (table `console_sessions`), plus the `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::Environment`, `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::ApprovalStatus`, and `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::ActionStatus` StrEnums. The authoritative list remains the set of `Base` subclasses in that module.
- **Two engines, one DSN** (`apps/api/src/curie_api/db.py::create_engine`, `apps/worker/src/curie_worker/run.py::build`): the API and the worker each build their own `create_async_engine(...)` from their own `database_url` setting (`apps/api/src/curie_api/config.py::Settings`, `apps/worker/src/curie_worker/config.py::WorkerConfig`), both read from `DATABASE_URL`, so a swap repoints both services. The worker never imports the API's models: it reaches the schema through hand-written SQL, both reading (`apps/worker/src/curie_worker/binding.py::_RESOLVE_SQL`, `apps/worker/src/curie_worker/binding.py::_UNDEPLOYED_BINDING_SQL`, `apps/worker/src/curie_worker/connector_loop.py::_TARGETS_SQL`) and writing (`apps/worker/src/curie_worker/publication_store.py::PostgresPublicationStore` updates `publications` / `approvals` under `FOR UPDATE ... SKIP LOCKED`). Table and column names are a second, ORM-independent coupling a conforming DB must honor.
- **Migrations**: the target DB must apply the **whole Alembic chain in `apps/api/alembic/versions/`**, in revision order, ending at `alembic heads`. The chain grows with the product, so it is deliberately not enumerated here: `ls apps/api/alembic/versions/` is the list, and `alembic heads` is the tip a conforming DB must reach. A single head is the invariant — a fork means two branches each added a migration (rebase and merge the heads before swapping anything). Two recent expand revisions make authenticated review feedback part of this schema contract: `0042_review_lineage_authority.py` adds immutable App-observed authority to publication lineages and the `publication_review_reservations` concurrency table; `0043_github_review_feedback.py` adds the `github_review_deliveries` audit table and the `github_review_feedback` durable feedback/outbox table. The latter stores normalized feedback and a credential-free queued turn, never a raw webhook body or GitHub credential.

## Implementations today

One: the compose/dev Postgres. Two SQLAlchemy async engines reach it, the API's
(`apps/api/src/curie_api/db.py::create_engine`) and the worker's
(`apps/worker/src/curie_worker/run.py::build`), each built from its own settings object
but from the same `DATABASE_URL`. Tests point the API engine at the compose Postgres by
overriding `database_url` (per the `apps/api/src/curie_api/db.py` module docstring).

## Known leakage

These Postgres-isms make the "just change the DSN" story leak for a non-Postgres store.
The list is enumerated rather than totalled in prose on purpose: what counts as one ism
is a judgement call, not something derivable from the tree.

1. **`postgresql.UUID` column type** — `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::UUID` is imported
   from `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql` and used as `UUID(as_uuid=True)` on every primary
   and foreign key (e.g. `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::Agent`). This is a dialect-specific type.
2. **Schema-qualified tables + a schema-scoped native enum** — foreign keys are
   written as `f"{SCHEMA}.agents.id"` (`apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::AgentVersion`,
   `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::Deployment`) and the `environment`
   column is a native Postgres `Enum(Environment, name="environment", schema=SCHEMA)`
   (`apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::Deployment`), which materializes as a `CREATE TYPE` in the `curie` schema.
3. **`JSONB` column type** — `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::JSONB` is imported from
   `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql` on the same line as `UUID` and used on **22** columns:
   `behavior_packs`, `approval_required_tools`, `approval_routes`, `secrets`,
   `hook_partitions`, `source_bindings`, `runner_resources`, `changed_paths`, `evidence`, `arguments`,
   `result`, `prior_state`, `target`, `post_state`, `feedback`, `turn`, `declaration`, `activity`,
   `scopes`, and `value`. The last one is
   declared twice, on `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::WorkflowStateEntry.value` and on
   `ThreadTranscript.value`, which holds one thread's transcript (ADR-0170); `evidence` is used
   by both approval and action audit rows. Three of them are
   load-bearing rather than incidental: the workflow-state store exists precisely because
   Postgres JSONB meant no new datastore was needed (see that class's docstring), the
   action ledger's `prior_state` holds a snapshot whose shape belongs to whatever resource
   a connector wrote to, which no column type can know in advance (ADR-0117), and
   `hook_partitions` holds per-hook delivery partitioning — hook name to the JSON Pointer
   into a delivery body naming the thing each delivery is about; NULL means one thread
   per hook (ADR-0134, Draft). `source_bindings` holds the operator-controlled
   workload-to-allowlisted-repository map for inbound hooks (#2572). The review-feedback
   outbox likewise stores a normalized `feedback` object and credential-free serialized
   `turn` as JSONB. `scopes` is `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::ProviderInstallation.scopes`,
   the list of provider scopes granted to a connected external account (#2909).
4. **Raw dialect-specific SQL outside the ORM** — `DISTINCT ON`, which is Postgres-only,
   is written by hand in `apps/api/src/curie_api/commitpoller.py::_DEPLOYED_SQL` (executed
   through `text(...)` in `apps/api/src/curie_api/commitpoller.py::CommitPoller.poll_once`)
   and in `apps/worker/src/curie_worker/connector_loop.py::_TARGETS_SQL`. The worker's
   read path adds a driver-level dependency on top of the dialect one:
   `apps/worker/src/curie_worker/binding.py::BindingResolver.resolve` decodes the JSONB
   columns with `json.loads` because asyncpg returns JSONB as a `str` for a raw-text
   `SELECT`, and `apps/worker/src/curie_worker/binding.py::_RESOLVE_SQL` orders on
   `(d.environment = 'prod')`, comparing the native enum of item 2 against a string
   literal.
5. **`UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT` workflow-state identity** —
   `workflow_state_entries` treats `binding_scope IS NULL` as the one real shared scope
   identity, rather than as an absent value. This preserves the shared state of a
   `memory=True` agent (including a legacy general-state row) and the permanently
   agent-wide `memory` and `transcript` namespaces. The named
   `uq_state_agent_scope_ns_key` constraint therefore makes
   `(agent_id, binding_scope, namespace, key)` unique with `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`;
   ordinary Postgres unique semantics would allow duplicate NULL tuples. This clause is
   PostgreSQL-specific and was added in PostgreSQL 15, which is the minimum server
   version for this relational contract.
6. **`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE ... SKIP LOCKED`** — the worker's
   `apps/worker/src/curie_worker/publication_store.py::PostgresPublicationStore`
   claims publication and approval rows under `FOR UPDATE OF p SKIP LOCKED` (and
   sibling `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` statements in the same module) so concurrent
   workers do not block on one another's in-flight claim. The API uses the same
   clause on other claim paths
   (`apps/api/src/curie_api/crud.py::claim_resume_row`,
   `apps/api/src/curie_api/resumereconciler.py::ResumeReconciler`). A second
   engine that honors the models but not this skip-locked claim would serialize
   those loops.
7. **Partial unique indexes** use the Postgres-only `postgresql_where` dialect
   argument to enforce active publication invariants. Two indexes on
   `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::ThreadPublicationLineage` permit only one
   open lineage for each agent conversation and repository, whether that repository
   is addressed by full name or GitHub repository id. The index on
   `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::PublicationReviewReservation` permits only
   one reserved review per lineage, and the index on
   `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::Publication` permits only one live
   publication per lineage. A target without partial unique indexes cannot express
   those database-level concurrency constraints as written.

Items 1 to 3 are cheap within the Postgres family: any managed Postgres speaks all three
natively, so the DSN-only swap is unaffected by them. Item 4 is different in kind: it is
dialect-specific and driver-specific SQL living in application code, so it leaks past the
stated contract as well as past Postgres; swapping the models and migrations would not
carry it, and a reader looking only at `models.py` would not find it. Item 5 is likewise
a database-level contract rather than a model type: it is native on a supported managed
Postgres, but a pre-15 server cannot represent Curie's singular NULL shared identity.
Item 6 is a row-claim concurrency primitive: native on Postgres, not on every
SQLAlchemy target. Item 7 makes publication uniqueness conditional on row status,
which likewise depends on a Postgres index feature. All seven items would need rework for a different RDBMS, which is
the marker that a real port should be extracted first.

## Cross-links

- **Swap guide + validation:** [managed-postgres-swap.md](./managed-postgres-swap.md) — the DSN-only swap to RDS/Cloud SQL/Neon, with the `apps/api/tests/test_managed_pg_swap.py` smoke test that proves the migration chain applies against a DSN-selected throwaway database (#283). That test covers leakage items 1 and 2 only; items 3 through 7 have no equivalent managed-swap assertion.

**Kind legend:** CLEAN = a real `Protocol`/typed port class · SOFT = swap via env/URL/prefix/wire, no code interface · NONE = not built yet.

## The black line

The port is the `MemoryStore` `Protocol` in
`runner/src/curie_runner/memory.py` (issue #264, ADR-0025). Two methods:

```python
class MemoryStore(Protocol):
    async def load(self) -> list[MemoryRecord]: ...
    async def append(self, record: MemoryRecord) -> None: ...
```

A `MemoryRecord` is `content: str` plus a `Provenance`
(`learned_from_session_id`, `source_trace_ids`, `recorded_at`, optional `source`) —
the entry→source-traces link. `Provenance.source` (`runner/src/curie_runner/memory.py::Provenance`)
is `"operator"` for a CLI/API-seeded record (#1904) and `None`/absent for a learned
record. `SessionConfig.memory_ref`
(`packages/aci-protocol/src/aci_protocol/session.py::SessionConfig`, `CURIE_MEMORY_REF`) is
resolved to a concrete `MemoryStore` at runner boot by `resolve_memory`. The
frozen ACI field is unchanged; the state-API bearer is a runner-local knob
(`CURIE_MEMORY_TOKEN`), not part of the frozen env.

## Current contract

- **Resolution.** `resolve_memory(memory_ref, env)`: an absent ref →
  `NullMemoryStore`; an `http(s)://` ref → `StateApiMemoryStore`; any other
  scheme (`s3://` …) is reserved for a future loader and rejected loudly.
- **Load side.** `load()` returns prior records oldest-first (empty when none).
  At boot the runner loads memory and composes it into the effective system
  prompt as a preamble — this is how memory is *delivered into the sandbox*. A
  transient load failure degrades to "no memory" and does not block boot.
- **Append side.** `append(record)` durably writes one record; provenance is
  stamped by `SessionRunner.remember(content, source_trace_ids=...)`. The record
  survives suspend/resume and is reloaded at the next boot.

## Implementations today

Two stores over the same backing. The `MemoryStore` port has one loader; the
facts store (`MemoryFactsStore`, below) sits beside the port, not behind it.

**`StateApiMemoryStore`** is the port's loader, backing memory as a scoped `memory` namespace
over the durable KV/document store landed for #23/#248
(`apps/api` `/agents/{agent_id}/state/{namespace}/{key}`, Postgres JSONB).
`load` GETs the single log-shaped key; `append` POSTs to that key's `/append`
endpoint (#248), inheriting durability and the per-value/per-namespace size caps.
The worker (`binding.boot_env`) delivers the ref as
`http(s)://api/agents/<id>/state/memory` and forwards a scoped, agent-bound
`state` token (ADR-0033, #410) as the memory token rather than the raw platform
key, except on a default local/cluster eval turn whose `conversation_id`
starts with `eval:` (#1909): that path omits the ref so the runner boots
`NullMemoryStore` and a deployed memory log cannot change a static suite.
`NullMemoryStore` is also the no-ref sink.

### Facts, channel memory and the memory tools (#1461, ADR-0167)

Beside the legacy `log`, memory also holds **facts**, read and written by
`runner/src/curie_runner/memory_facts.py::MemoryFactsStore` rather than through
the `MemoryStore` port. A fact is one key `fact-<32 hex>` whose value is
`{statement, author, stated_at, session_id}`. Facts live in two namespaces
reached with the same memory token:

- **Agent memory**, at `CURIE_MEMORY_REF`, loaded in every channel. It also
  holds two reserved keys that are never facts: `log` (above) and `guidance`
  (`{"text": ...}`, an operator's replacement for the default guidance).
- **Channel memory**, at `CURIE_CHANNEL_MEMORY_REF`
  (`BootEnv.channel_memory_ref`), the binding-scoped namespace
  `.../agents/<id>/state/bindings/<kind>/<address>/memory`. The worker sets it
  only when the agent's `memory_writes` setting is on and the turn has a
  binding, and never on an eval-isolated turn.

At boot the runner lists whichever of the two it was given and renders a
"Remembered facts" block (agent facts, then channel facts, newest first, at
most 200 per memory, each statement flattened to one line and framed as data,
not instructions) after the legacy log preamble. Each line reads
`- [<id>] <statement> (stated by <author> on <YYYY-MM-DD>)`, or
`(author unknown, ...)` when no person is recorded; the author is flattened and
capped at 64 characters, and the block tells the model to weigh each fact by who
stated it. With memory writes off no channel ref is minted, so only agent facts
are loaded. When
`CURIE_CHANNEL_MEMORY_REF` is set it also mounts `remember`, `update` and
`forget` on the platform `curie` server and injects the guidance block
(`guidance` if stored, else `DEFAULT_GUIDANCE`) before the bundle prompt. The
tools take `memory: agent|channel`; the author is the turn's sender, never a
tool argument. A write the state API refuses at its cap is reported to the model
as refused. The tools are exempt from bundle toolPolicy by published name, and
the worker leaves them out of change receipts.

## Known leakage

- **Scoped memory token (was: shared API key).** Earlier the state API's one
  shared platform key was forwarded into the sandbox as `CURIE_MEMORY_TOKEN`,
  granting that key's full scope. ADR-0033 (#410) closed that: the worker now
  mints a scoped, agent-bound, HMAC-signed `state` token per turn, accepted only
  by the state router and bound to this agent's namespace, so the sandbox
  credential can no longer resolve approvals or reach another agent's state. The
  platform key still authenticates the state router for operators, the CLI, and
  the worker's own control-plane calls.
- **Consolidation is an opt-in capability, not part of the port.** The core
  `MemoryStore` port stays `load`/`append` only. Consolidation (#265) adds a
  separate `SupportsReplace` capability (`replace(records)`) and the
  `consolidate_memory(store)` entry point (also `SessionRunner.consolidate_memory`):
  it loads the append-only log, merges equivalent-content records via
  `consolidate_records` while **unioning their provenance** (`merge_provenance` —
  no source trace is lost), and writes the compacted set back only when the store
  advertises `replace` and the pass actually reduced the record count.
  `StateApiMemoryStore.replace` is a blind PUT of the log key; `NullMemoryStore`
  and any read-only backing make consolidation a reporting-only no-op. Automatic
  learned-record *extraction* remains later work.
- **An operator read/write plane sits below the port, not on it.** The
  inspect, seed, trace-back, edit, and delete surface (#266, #267, #1904) is
  `apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/memory.py`
  (`apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/memory.py::list_memory`,
  `apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/memory.py::create_memory`,
  `apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/memory.py::memory_trace_back`,
  `apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/memory.py::edit_memory`,
  `apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/memory.py::delete_memory`), and it never goes
  through `MemoryStore`. It reads and mutates the backing
  `apps/api/src/curie_api/models.py::WorkflowStateEntry` row with SQLAlchemy
  directly (edit and delete are compare-and-set on that row's `version`), keeps
  its own copy of the log coordinates
  (`apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/memory.py::MEMORY_NAMESPACE` and
  `apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/memory.py::MEMORY_LOG_KEY`, mirroring the
  runner's `runner/src/curie_runner/memory.py::MEMORY_LOG_KEY`), re-declares the
  `{content, provenance}` item shape in
  `apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/memory.py::_records_of`, and borrows the state
  router's size caps (`apps/api/src/curie_api/routers/state.py::_enforce_caps`).
  Its consumers are the CLI (`cli/src/api.rs`, behind `curie local memory` /
  `curie local memory --add` and `curie cluster memory` /
  `curie cluster memory --add`) and the console (`apps/ui/src/api/client.ts`). Unlike
  the sandbox path it is platform-key-only (`require_api_key`), so the scoped
  memory token cannot reach it. This is coherent today (one loader plus the facts
  store, one backing store, and the router says so in its own docstring), but it is the precise leak
  a real second loader would trip over: an `s3://` store would satisfy the port
  and still leave every operator read returning an empty list and every edit and
  delete 404ing, because the operator plane is addressing a Postgres row that
  loader never writes.
- **No query on the port; the query and edit surface lives below it.** The port
  is still `load`/`append` (plus optional `replace`), with no query language, and
  the runner reads the whole log. Listing, trace-back, edit, and delete do exist
  in the system, as the operator plane above rather than as port methods. The
  load-bearing constraint remains: **memory lives OUTSIDE the sandbox**
  (ADR-0003) — the store is network-reachable and rehydratable, not pod-local
  state.

"""The concurrency kernel: route one Slack event to a runner turn, get every
failure mode right.

Rules implemented here (detailed-architecture section 2b):

1. One live session per thread. A follow-up to a thread with a live turn is a
   *steer* into that turn, not a new turn. The per-thread lock plus opening the
   new turn *before* releasing the lock guarantees a thread never has two turns.
2. The finish race. A steer that arrives as the turn ends returns 409; the kernel
   then opens a fresh turn on the same (idle) sandbox. This check-and-fall-back
   is the compare-and-swap the worker owns.
3. Steer vs interrupt. Default is steer; ``interrupt_thread`` is the explicit
   hard stop (a Slack :stop: affordance would call it). We never keyword-guess.
5. No auto-retry after side effects. A failed run that emitted ``side_effect_flag``
   escalates to a human instead of retrying; the flag is persisted the instant it
   is seen so a crash mid-side-effect still escalates on reclaim. Flag-clean
   failures retry by error classification (rate-limit / runner-error /
   runner-timeout / workspace-error are transient; budget-exceeded and
   everything else escalate).

Idempotency: the Slack event id gates a ``done`` marker so a redelivered or
reclaimed event that already finished is skipped.

    the turn verbatim -- so with one agent reachable on several addresses
    (ADR-0096 phase 2) the bare id is no longer an identity. Two channels can
    hand the worker the same conversation id for two unrelated conversations.

    This key names every piece of worker-internal state a thread owns: its
    sandbox route (and with it the transcript/history ref the sandbox boots
    against), its per-thread Valkey lock and in-process order lock, and its
    approval-card slot. Keying any of those on the bare id lets the second
    channel's turn adopt the first channel's live session, inheriting its
    transcript and its bundle.

    It is never what goes on the wire. ``ReplyTarget.conversation_id`` keeps the
    BARE adapter id, because adapters thread their replies on it -- the Slack
    sink sends it straight back as ``thread_ts`` -- so a scoped id there would
    reply into a thread that does not exist. Same reason the dispatcher keeps
    minting bare ids: the scoping is the worker's own, and it starts here.

    Each segment is percent-encoded, so no combination can collide with
    another by moving a separator. The route's identity (``route_identity``)
    is a segment after the kind unless it is none or ``default``
    (ADR-0168 decision 4), built by ``channel_protocol.scoped_conversation_id``
    itself, so a pre-ADR key is unchanged and a named one has one more

# Wrapping it in `asyncio.wait_for` cannot stop the underlying thread (the
# executor slot stays occupied until the call actually returns), but it does
# return control to the caller so the tick is not held hostage by it; a timed

# turn can hold the route lock for up to the substrate's claim timeout, and a
# reset must not park the maintenance tick waiting on it. A lock that cannot be

        ADR-0131's reclaim rules 2, 3 and 4, in that order. Rule 1 -- "a
        side-effect marker forbids replay and settles to human escalation" -- is
        the existing ``saw_side_effect`` check in ``_process_event``, which runs
        BEFORE this and needs no code here; that ordering is load-bearing and is
        pinned by a test rather than duplicated as a second check, because a
        preflight that interrupted, waited and then rehydrated could otherwise
        re-execute a half-done non-idempotent action.

        Rule 2: a runner that still reports an active turn is interrupted and
        must become idle (or disappear) before the retry. The interrupt goes
        through ``interrupt_thread``, the EXISTING bounded control path -- no
        second mechanism, and never a bare task cancel, which would skip the
        runner-side stop.

        Rule 3: an unreadable runner FAILS CLOSED. ``_turn_active`` already
        reports busy when liveness cannot be read, so an unreadable runner
        exhausts the bounded poll and this raises, leaving the stream entry
        pending. A replacement never runs beside a possibly-active turn -- the
        "just retry it" simplification is precisely the failure mode this
        refuses.

        Rule 4 is what falling off the end of this method means: old authority is
        fenced (the lease generation moved), the old runner is inactive, and no
        side-effect marker exists.

        This deliberately diverges from the ordinary route, which STEERS into a
        retained live turn: this is the same event being retried, not a follow-up.
        The choice is driven by the lease generation, an explicit distributed
        state fact, so kernel rule 3 ("never keyword-guess intent") is untouched.

        """Force-release the thread's sandbox (#713, an operator action): delete
        its substrate claim and route so the next message cold-creates fresh,
        picking up current model/Slack config instead of adopting a sandbox
        that may be running stale env from when it first booted. History is
        not lost -- a cold-created sandbox rehydrates its transcript from the
        durable state store on claim, the same as any other fresh claim.

        Any live turn is interrupted first so `release` never yanks the claim
        out from under a running turn without at least trying to stop it
        cleanly, but the interrupt is a courtesy and never a precondition
        (#739). The case that matters is a live handle whose runner is
        unresponsive: a wedged runner accepts the TCP connect and then answers
        `/v1/interrupt` never, so the call rides `RunnerClient`'s own 600s
        request timeout. That is exactly the sandbox an operator is resetting,
        and awaiting it unbounded costs twice: the release line below is never
        reached, and the reset request has already been SPOPped off the pending
        set by the maintenance tick, so a raise loses it permanently rather
        than retrying next tick. The same tick also owns stream reclaim and
        orphan reaping, which stall for the whole window behind it.

        So the interrupt is bounded to `_RESET_INTERRUPT_TIMEOUT_S` and any
        failure (timeout, transport error, non-200) is logged and swallowed; the
        release then runs unconditionally. `CancelledError` is deliberately not
        swallowed, so worker shutdown still cuts through.

        The release itself is also bounded, to `_RESET_RELEASE_TIMEOUT_S` (#743):
        a hang in the K8s control plane rather than the runner would otherwise
        stall this `asyncio.to_thread` -- and therefore the whole maintenance
        tick behind it -- indefinitely too, since `to_thread` is not
        cancellable. A timed-out release is NOT swallowed here; it propagates
        like any other release failure, which the drain loop's per-request
        handler already logs and isolates from the rest of the batch.

        The release runs under the SAME per-thread route lock the turn path
        holds around `_route_and_start` (#734). Without it the release is
        lock-free while a concurrent turn for this thread holds only that lock,
        so a message arriving in the window between the interrupt above and the
        release below can `claim()`-adopt the very sandbox this is tearing down
        and open a turn on it -- which the release then yanks mid-run. The
        interrupt cannot cover that turn: it fired before the turn existed, so
        it no-oped. Taking the lock makes the two mutually exclusive. A reset
        that wins the lock drops the route while holding it, so a turn waiting
        to route then cold-creates a fresh sandbox (exactly the reset's intent)
        instead of adopting the doomed one. A turn that wins the lock opens
        first and the reset serializes behind its `_route_and_start`, then tears
        it down as an ordinary live-thread reset (the turn replays on a fresh
        sandbox via the `runner-error` retry path described below). Either way
        no turn is ever left streaming on a sandbox this released out from under
        it without the reset first having serialized against its start.

        The lock hold spans only the release (interrupt-then-lock, not the
        reverse), so the bounded-but-possibly-slow courtesy interrupt does not
        extend the window turn-starts for this thread are blocked; the hold is
        the release bound (a few seconds), well under the lock's TTL.

        The failure log is an ERROR, not a warning: it is the only record that a
        sandbox was pulled out from under a turn that may still be running, and
        there is no retry that would produce a second, louder signal. The two
        success shapes are logged apart from it (and from each other) so an
        operator can tell "the live turn was killed" from "nothing was running"
        from "we released blind".

        Behavioral note for the unconditional release: when the thread really did
        have a live turn, tearing its sandbox down mid-run drops the turn stream,
        which `_consume` classifies as `runner-error`. That is in
        `RETRYABLE_CLASSIFICATIONS`, so the driving loop in `_run_event` retries
        the turn, and the retry re-claims, which cold-creates a fresh sandbox on
        current config -- exactly the state the reset was asking for. The
        no-auto-retry-after-side-effects rule still holds: an attempt that saw a
        `SideEffectFlag` escalates to a human instead of replaying. So a reset of
        a live thread is a replay on a fresh sandbox, not a lost turn, and the
        thread is never left routeless.

        ``turn`` is the streamed turn behind a delivered or escalated outcome.
        An escalated factory run finishes with the cause and provider message it
        carries (#3073); a delivered one that did not publish finishes as
        ``early_stop`` or ``no_pull_request`` with the agent's last message
        (#3128).

        For a valid cron run, close its Postgres row before these Valkey steps.

        1. write the outbox record       -- durable, BEFORE the done marker
        2. mark done + flag the record   -- ONE MULTI, so they cannot diverge
        3. emit ``turn.completed``       -- may fail
        4. clear the record              -- ONLY on a confirmed emit

        Step 3 failing is caught and logged, never raised: the turn is already
        durably done, and re-running it is the harm. The record survives so a
        sweeper (or the next redelivery) delivers the completion the adapter is
        still owed.

        The ONLY ``mark_done`` call site: every durable terminal outcome
        completes here, including the pre-resolution prior-side-effect
        escalation, whose route is the server-minted ``reply_handle``'s (EB-B2's
        second sanctioned source -- no adapter can write to the stream, so the
        handle is trustworthy). A terminal path that marked done without a record
        would be a completion nothing could ever recover.
        A targetless cron turn (#2963) is the one exception: no adapter is
        waiting, so no completion is owed, and ``_settle_targetless`` marks it
        done with no record.

        Since ADR-0131 this is also the FENCE. When the caller holds a delivery
        lease, steps 1 and 2 fuse into ``Markers.settle_fenced``, one script that
        verifies the lease token and the fencing generation and then performs the
        same two writes. That adds a PRECONDITION; it reorders nothing -- the
        record is still durable before/with the done marker, and it is still
        cleared only after a confirmed emit.

        A caller that fails the fence returns HERE, before ``_deliver_completion``
        is ever reached: ADR-0131 says a stale owner "may not ACK, dead-letter,
        clear an outbox record, or emit a terminal result", and all three of the
        latter live downstream of this point. It also marks the lease lost, so the
        consumer's pre-ACK ``raise_if_lost`` refuses the fourth verb too and the
        entry stays pending for whoever now holds the fence. Without that, a turn
        whose settle was refused would be acked with no completion written at all.

        A pass that delivers anything is by definition recovering a completion an

        answering with a count both callers threw away. A quiet pass -- the
        normal case -- stays silent.

        Called from the consumer's maintenance loop and once at startup, which
        is the case redelivery can NEVER reach: once a stream entry is acked
        there is nothing left to redeliver, so a redelivery-only sweep would
        strand the record forever.

        A member may be emitted only when BOTH hold:

        1. **the record is flagged done.** ``Markers.mark_done`` sets that flag
           in the same MULTI as the done marker, so a false flag means the
           kernel is mid-flight or crashed before durability -- the sweeper stays
           silent and stream redelivery reruns the turn, correctly. The flag is
           the WHOLE guard, with no marker fallback behind it: ``done_key``
           expires at ``idempotency_ttl_s`` while the record is retained for a
           week, so a guard resting on the marker could never pass after day
           one, and consulting it for a record whose flag says "not yet" lets a
           CONCURRENT retry's done marker authorize this pass to emit and clear
           a record that retry is still mid-flight on. A record with NO flag is
           malformed rather than legacy (the outbox is new in this train) and is
           quarantined, never guessed at.
        2. **the record is older than the grace period**, which keeps the
           sweeper out of the kernel's own emit window so the normal path is not
           racing it on every turn.

        The pass is BOUNDED, in members and in wall time (``completion_sweep_batch``
        / ``completion_sweep_budget_s``). Every delivery attempt is an HTTP call
        with the sink's own timeout, so an unbounded pass over an unreachable
        adapter is measured in hours -- and this same coroutine runs at startup,
        against exactly the backlog an outage left behind. The remainder is

        Approval id is the only identity used for the remembered ref. A resolved
        resume reads its durable verdict first, so an unavailable record defers
        settlement without touching the ref. Expiry needs no verdict read.

        The card ref is read without mutation and the Slack edit happens while
        the original value remains stored. Only confirmed delivery is followed
        by an atomic comparison and deletion of that exact value. A failed edit
        leaves the ref available to a reclaimed pass only when that delivery
        also fails before mark_done. Otherwise it remains until TTL.

        Two worker replicas may read the same ref and emit equivalent edits
        because both use the shared renderer. Only one can consume the matching
        value. Sequential redelivery finds no ref after successful cleanup. If a
        newer ref replaces the value during delivery, comparison preserves it.

        This remains fully best effort and never fails the resume. There is
        still no RUNTIME dual read: this path reads exactly one key, the

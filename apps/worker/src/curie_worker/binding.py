"""Deployment-to-runtime binding: resolve a channel address to the agent, its
active deployment, and the bundle + budget to boot the sandbox with.

The B1/J1/L1 Postgres tables are the source of truth. Rather than import the API
package (which would pull FastAPI and its ORM into the worker), this is a thin
read-only query layer over the same tables via a SQLAlchemy async engine: one
parameterized SELECT joining agents -> agent_channels -> deployments ->
agent_versions.

Resolution rule: an agent holds one or more rows in ``agent_channels``
(ADR-0096, #1459; ADR-0118). Resolution is from the ``(kind, address)`` pair to
the agent, so the count of bindings per agent never affects the predicate. The
run uses that agent's active
deployment (deployments.status = 'active'); when both a prod and a dev
deployment are active, prod wins, then the most recent. An address with no
agent, or an agent with no active deployment, resolves to None -- the kernel
answers with a polite placeholder and drops the event rather than crashing.
Per-channel dev/prod bot-identity routing (the dispatcher carrying which bot was
addressed) is a J1/dispatcher refinement noted for later.

Contract (cross-lane, load-bearing): ``agent_channels.address`` MUST store the
channel address the dispatcher enqueues as ``QueuedTurn.reply_handle.channel``,
because the kernel passes that value into ``resolve()`` and this resolver
matches on equality. If the create-agent API/UI stores a Slack channel NAME
(``#triage``) instead of its ID, every real mention resolves to None and is
dropped. Storing the address correctly at agent creation (or translating it
there) is the API/UI's responsibility; this resolver deliberately does not
call any adapter's API to translate, to avoid coupling the worker to a
per-adapter token.

``agent_channels.kind`` ROUTES: since ADR-0096 phase 2 the queue wire
(``ReplyHandle``) carries a required ``kind``, so the routing key is the PAIR
(``kind`` AND ``address``) and migration 0023 widens the uniqueness constraint to
match; migration 0070 widens it again to the route triple, so several
identities may share a pair. There is no address-only overload and no default
kind -- either would be the silent address-fallback the pair exists to remove.
One address can now legitimately be bound twice under two different kinds, and
each turn reaches its own agent.

The binding row also carries the server-controlled reply route: ``endpoint`` (the
channel API base URL this kind's replies go back through) and ``adapter`` (the
egress adapter identity whose credential authenticates them). Both are read here
so the worker gets the route from the same query that resolves the agent, never
from an ingress request body. ``slack`` never carries an ``endpoint``, because
its route is the worker's configured Slack origin, but it DOES name its bot
identity in ``adapter`` (ADR-0168 decision 3). A turn queued without one means
``default``, read through ``route_identity``, never "no route" the way a
non-Slack NULL pair does. The worker resolves by all three fields: the SQL
selects the pair and ``matching_routes`` (``aci_protocol.turn``) narrows by
identity, so a route bound under one Slack identity does not answer a turn
addressed to another.

A pair that is not bound, or bound but not to this turn's identity, resolves
to None -- a polite drop naming both halves, never a fallback to the address
alone, because that fallback is exactly the silent misroute (#38) this
predicate closes.

        name the runner gate should let through once; otherwise None. Derived
        server-side from the durable ``approvals`` row, so a compromised sandbox
        cannot mint one.

        Provenance is a COLUMN, not a string prefix (#544, Decision C). The
        runner writes ``gate_kind`` and ``granted_tool``; this method returns the
        ``granted_tool`` column and does not re-derive it. Three cases on
        ``gate_kind``:

        * ``'policy'`` or ``'permission'`` -- return the ``granted_tool`` column
          (or None when NULL). For a permission gate this is the trusted
          ``can_use_tool`` value the runner denied. For a policy gate, #558
          (superseding ADR-0046 Decision C's outright refusal) lets an
          operator-opted ``grantableViaPolicy`` gate carry a grant: the runner
          stamps the MANIFEST-declared tool onto ``granted_tool`` for exactly
          those gates and leaves it NULL for every other policy gate, so honoring
          the column grants the opted-in gates and preserves #544's no-grant
          default (NULL -> None) elsewhere. The value is never model-authored
          (runner-sourced from the manifest), never a parse of the summary, so
          the #430/#410 forgery seam stays closed.
        * ``NULL`` -- the rolling-deploy window (edge case 7): a NEW worker met an
          OLD pinned runner whose final carried no provenance. Fall back to the
          legacy summary-prefix parse -- byte-identical to today's behavior, so a
          no-op for old rows that cannot widen anything. Deleted once no old
          runner can be live (follow-up 2).

        The grant is agent-bound: the row's ``agent_id`` MUST be non-NULL and
        equal ``agent_id`` (the agent currently resolved for this channel).
        A NULL row agent_id or a mismatch returns None -- fail-safe, never a
        cross-agent grant. This closes a rebind leak: if a channel is rebound to
        a different agent while an approval is pending, agent A's grant must not
        be injected into agent B's runner and cross-authorize a shared tool name.

    model demo path injects a generic Anthropic compatible base URL when
    configured; an explicit model is forwarded whenever set.

    the runner sends no thinking configuration and the model's own default

    Those two are the only per-agent knobs here. The api_backend and env_key declarations

    wire protocol is dialed and which env var a credential is read from, so a
    lower-privileged agent author must not be able to set them.

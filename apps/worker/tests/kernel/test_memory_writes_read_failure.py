"""#1461 G1: a failed ``memory_writes_for`` read never fails the bound turn.

The setting is read apart from deployment resolution (like runner_resources) so
resolution keeps working on schemas that predate migration 0068. The same holds
for the read itself: a database error, or a schema without the column, must
leave the turn running with memory writes off and a warning, never a failed turn.

Real kernel harness (Valkey, fake substrate), like test_kernel_progress_env.py.

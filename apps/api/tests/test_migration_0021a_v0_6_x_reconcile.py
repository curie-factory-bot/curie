"""A v0.6.x database must be able to reach head (#1705).

Revision id `0021` means `console_sessions` on the v0.6.x line and
`agent_channels` on this one, and both sides declare `down_revision = "0020"`.
So a v0.6.x database arrives already stamped `0021`, this chain concludes
`0021_agent_channels` has run, skips it, and `0022` joins a `curie.agent_channels`
that was never created. `0021a_agent_channels_reconcile` closes that, and `0026`
then has to skip a `console_sessions` table the database already holds.

No gate in this repo saw it, because every tier builds its database from zero.
This test builds one that does not: this tree's own `0001`..`0020` (byte
identical on both release lines), plus the `console_sessions` DDL that shipped
as v0.6.2's `0021`, stamped `0021`. That DDL is written out here rather than
borrowed from `0026`: it is frozen released history, and a fixture that read the
current tree for it would stop describing what operators actually hold the
moment that revision is touched.

Two separate failures are asserted, because the first one hides the second, and
because reaching head is not on its own the property that matters. 0021's own
docstring is explicit that creating `agent_channels` without the
`INSERT ... SELECT` produces a perfectly valid empty table and silently unbinds
every agent in the install, so a reconciliation that skipped the backfill would
satisfy a "reaches head" assertion while being worse than the crash it replaced.

Follows `test_migration_0021_agent_channels.py`: a throwaway database all to
itself via `isolated_migration_db`, real Postgres, no mocking.

"""Runtime configuration for the Curie API server.

All values default to the compose dev stack (see compose.dev.yaml and
.env.example) so a local run needs no .env, with one exception: the two S3
credentials default to empty, because an empty credential is the signal that
selects the AWS provider chain for the key-free BYO object store path (#1559).
A local run against the compose RustFS therefore has to supply them, from .env
or the environment; the dev values live in .env.example and compose.dev.yaml.

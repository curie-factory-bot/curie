    """Build the gate shared by every nullable operator override (#1310, #1355, #1392).

    Refuses a blank and normalizes what it accepts: the returned value is
    stripped, so one paste stores one value no matter which surface it came
    through.

    `model` and `thinking` are the same kind of field consumed the same way, and
    they must answer an empty string the same way. `apply_model_env` reads each as
    `override if override is not None else config.<field>`, so `""` is not None and
    wins the ternary, and then `if value:` is falsy and NO boot key is emitted.
    An empty override therefore skips the platform default an operator configured
    and hands the decision to the model's own built-in -- the opposite of what
    someone typing `""` to clear a value expects. Explicit JSON null is the reset,
    and the error says so.

    Whitespace is worse than empty and is refused by the same predicate: `"  "`
    passes the falsy check downstream and is stored AND forwarded as a garbage
    value.

    #1334 attached this to `thinking` only, and its twin on the adjacent line kept
    accepting what its sibling refused. One factory, two call sites, so the next
    nullable override cannot drift either.

    None passes through: on PATCH that is the clear, on create it is "no override".
    The VOCABULARY of each field is deliberately not checked here -- a model id
    belongs to whatever harness is configured, and thinking's
    `disabled`/`adaptive`/`enabled:<n>` belongs to the runner
    (`curie_runner.thinking`) -- so swapping the harness is not a schema change.

    Args:

    Two independent refusals share this validator:

    ``self`` is reserved (ADR-0168 decision 7): ``admits`` uses it to mean the
    agent a bundle is deployed as, and ``deploy.yaml``'s ``target.agent``
    (``deploy.bad_agent_name``) and the CLI's per-agent secret binding already
    refuse a target genuinely named that, since it would be indistinguishable
    from the sentinel. ``POST /agents`` was the remaining hole, closed here the
    same way #1446 closed the ``-mcp-`` join below.

    A connector's Kubernetes objects are named
    ``{release}-{agent}-mcp-{connector}``
    (``plugin_format.connector_render.object_name``). The ``-mcp-`` is a bare
    substring inside one DNS label rather than a structural separator, so the
    join point is not recoverable from the rendered string: agent ``a-mcp-b``
    with connector ``c`` and agent ``a`` with connector ``b-mcp-c`` render
    byte-identical objects AND the identical ``app.kubernetes.io/name`` pod
    selector. That selector is what the connector's Service and both
    NetworkPolicies bind to, and the Deployment it names carries the caller
    proxy's admits list (ADR-0086, ADR-0168 decision 7), which makes that name
    what binds a sandbox to a credential: one agent's sandbox reaches another
    agent's connector holding another agent's production token, and nothing
    errors anywhere (#1446).

    ``connectors.yaml`` names and ``deploy.yaml``'s ``target.agent`` are both
    gated by bundle validation. ``POST /agents`` is the hole -- the stored
    ``Agent.name`` reaches the renderer with no field validator in between --
    and it is the path the CLI's ``resolve_agent`` and the UI's create modal
    both take. Refusing on write keeps the forging name out of the database
    entirely; the render-time 422 in ``routers/agents.py`` only covers rows
    created before this validator existed.

    Deliberately ONLY the delimiter-forging shape. ``AgentCreate.name`` accepts
    spaces, uppercase, and 200-character names today; that is a real but
    SEPARATE pre-existing gap, and tightening it here would refuse names live
    installs already hold. Do not "helpfully" widen this into general
    name-shape validation -- that is its own change, with its own migration
    story.

    The rule itself is imported, never restated: ``agent_forges_join`` asks
    whether ``-mcp-`` appears in ``f"{name}-"``, which catches a TRAILING
    ``-mcp`` (the join supplies the dash that completes it) as surely as an
    outright ``-mcp-``, while leaving a LEADING ``mcp-`` alone -- its only
    alternative split leaves an empty agent, so nothing is ambiguous. A second
    copy of that asymmetry here would be free to drift from the renderer it
    exists to protect.

    durable on the row and ABSENT from every read; `adapter` is now part of the
    route's identity rather than only a credential, so it is present on both
    sides. A write-side policy on the shared model would 422 valid reads and
    leak a write rule into a read contract.

    The rules, stated here because this is the write path every caller (UI,
    API, CLI) passes through; `agent_channels_route_ck` states the first two
    at the database for out-of-band writers:

    - **A Slack route names its identity**, `default` when omitted, and has no
      endpoint (ADR-0168 decision 3): its replies go through the worker's
      configured Slack origin, so an endpoint is refused by field name.
    - **Any other kind is both or neither.** A half-configured route is an
      operator error that would otherwise surface as a fail-closed escalation
      mid-turn, in the worker, far from the request that caused it.
    - **Both absent is legal** for a non-Slack kind: the cutover binds the
      agent first and PATCHes the route in later. The gate for an unroutable
      binding is `POST /channels/token`, which refuses (409) to mint for a
      non-`slack` binding with no route.
    - **`adapter` is a lowercase slug**, on the same pattern as `kind`, because
      it is a CONFIG-MAP KEY on the worker
      (`config.adapter_credentials[route.adapter]`): a value carrying a quote, a
      space or a `:` is a config-injection shape, not a name.
    - **`endpoint` is an absolute http(s) URL with a host and NO userinfo.** The
      worker POSTs the platform's AUTHENTICATED reply to this value, so an empty
      string or a nonsense URL is a binding that mints tokens and passes ingress
      and then fails closed mid-turn in the worker -- the same E17 failure the
      route pair exists to foreclose, arriving one layer later. Userinfo
      (`https://user:pass@host/`) is refused separately: a credential in the
      stored URL is one git-grep, one log line and one error message away from
      disclosure, and the `adapter` field is where a credential belongs.

    Neither the value nor any part of it appears in the messages below. An
    endpoint can carry a token in its path or query, so error text -- which is
    returned to the caller and written to logs -- names the FIELD and states the
    rule instead of echoing what was sent.

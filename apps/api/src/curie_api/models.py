    Replaces `agents.slack_channel` (migration 0021) so an agent can bind a
    channel kind the platform has never heard of without a schema change.

    `kind` names the owning adapter, selects the address-shape validator
    (`schemas._validate_channel_binding`), AND routes: since ADR-0096 phase 2 the
    queue wire carries a required `ReplyHandle.kind`, so the worker resolves on
    the PAIR and the uniqueness below widened to match (migration 0023). The
    widening was only safe once no address-only consumer could run -- a
    pair-unique constraint under an address-only lookup would let two agents hold
    one address while the resolver could not tell them apart, which is #38's
    silent misrouting wearing a different hat. That ordering is why 0023 lands
    after the cutover proves no old worker is running. Migration 0070 widens the
    key to `(kind, address, adapter)` (ADR-0168 decision 3).

    `endpoint`/`adapter` are the server-controlled reply route: where this kind's
    replies go back through, and which egress credential authenticates them. They
    are set here by the platform and never accepted from an ingress request body.
    `generation` counts rotations: `update_channel_binding` mutates this row IN
    PLACE, and `POST /channels/token` bumps it on every mint, so the row id is a
    stable identity and the generation is the only thing that makes a rebind or
    remint observable to a credential minted before it.

    `allowed_callers` (ADR 0175, migration 0068) is who may start a turn through
    this binding: NULL for everyone, else the exact caller ids `admission.admit`
    matches. It is written only by its own endpoint, which leaves `generation`

    Only HASHES of the code and the token are stored, so reading this table cannot
    replay a session -- the same reason `Approval` does not store credentials. And
    revocation is `revoked_at`, a column write: a durable row a human can kill,
    rather than a self-contained signed token that stays valid until it expires.
    That distinction is why ADR-0083 rejected a stateless JWT-shaped token.

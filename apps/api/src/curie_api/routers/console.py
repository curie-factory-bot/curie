"""Console session exchange and authenticated current-session inspection.

ADR-0083, first slice (#1044) of #630. The console holds the shared platform
administrator key in browser code today -- resolved from `?api_key=`, a build
variable, or a published dev default -- which puts a credential that authorizes
deployments, approvals, budgets and the kill switch into browser history, request
logs and referrers, revocable only by rotating the Secret and restarting the API.

Two endpoints, deliberately asymmetric:

- ``POST /console/login-codes`` requires the immutable platform-key-only
  dependency. Minting is an administrative act, and the CLI is the intended
  caller. The administrator-selected subject is bound to the row at mint time.
- ``POST /console/session`` requires NO credential, because the login code IS the
  credential being presented. It is the one unauthenticated write in the API, so
  it is bounded on purpose: the code is single-use and short-lived, a failure is
  indistinguishable from any other failure (so codes cannot be probed), and
  success grants a session, never the platform key.

ADR-0106 consumes the live session only as an approval principal. The cookie
does not become a platform key and cannot call either administrative mint.

Readers accept only ``__Host-curie_console_session``. Sessions already minted
under ``curie_console_session`` stop working; the session TTL is 12 hours, and
the operator exchanges a new login code.

    Every mutating binding handler opens with this, and then picks its target

    re-reads count=1 and conflicts. The lock also serializes `generation += 1`
    into an increment instead of a lost update.

    `populate_existing` is load-bearing: the handler has already loaded the
    agent (for its 404), so its bindings are in the session's identity map, and
    a plain locking SELECT would hand those STALE objects back -- the row would
    be locked while the generation the caller compares against came from before
    the winner's commit.

    Known and accepted conservatism: `FOR UPDATE` locks rows that exist; it does
    not block a concurrent INSERT. A DELETE racing an ADD may therefore 409 as
    "last binding" even though a second binding commits moments later. That
    direction is safe (a retry succeeds) and is cheaper than the predicate lock

    tripping `agent_channels_route_key` on a move that is perfectly legal.

    That in-place mutation is exactly why `generation` exists (ADR-0096 D5): the

    before the move stays pointed at the row afterwards and would follow it to
    its NEW owner. The generation is what makes the rebind observable to that
    credential. It is bumped UNCONDITIONALLY on every write to the ROUTE through
    this function, including one whose values are identical -- an operator
    re-asserting a binding is the "I think something is wrong with this route"
    gesture that should invalidate outstanding credentials, and guarding the
    bump on a value change would leave that case silently valid. `POST
    /channels/token` is the sibling bump: a remint increments the same counter
    so rotation revokes (#2379). Not every binding write bumps it: editing the
    caller list (`set_allowed_callers`) deliberately does not (ADR 0175
    decision 4).

    narrowed.

    This function deliberately still returns a bare None and does not say which

    approval is routeless here; the selector keys on the same truthiness so the

    A present-but-non-dict value is NOT one of those misses, so it is returned

    The ``resumed_at < dead_lettered_after`` guard is LOAD-BEARING for

# --- generic OIDC login (#2908, ADR 0155 step 3) ----------------------------
#
# The login transaction and the principal it resolves to. The callback runs
# consume -> exchange -> validate -> resolve -> mint in that order, and each
# step here is written so a crash or a concurrent duplicate between two of them
# cannot yield a second use of one attempt or a second row for one identity.

#: How long a started login may take to come back from the IdP. Long enough for
#: a person to type a password and pass MFA, short enough that an abandoned
#: attempt stops being redeemable soon after.
OIDC_LOGIN_TTL = timedelta(minutes=10)
#: Most live (unconsumed, unexpired) login attempts that may exist at once. The
#: login start is unauthenticated and writes a row, so expiry alone bounds the
#: table only by time: an anonymous flood would grow it by (rate x TTL). A
#: fixed cap bounds it by count instead. 1000 is far above any real appliance's
#: concurrent logins in a ten-minute window, and small enough that counting and
#: pruning stay cheap on the ``expires_at`` index. At the cap new logins are
#: refused (a flood can delay logins, but cannot exhaust the database).
OIDC_LOGIN_ATTEMPT_CAP = 1000

#: Advisory-lock key serializing the prune/count/insert in
#: :func:`create_oidc_login_attempt`, so concurrent login starts cannot all
#: pass the count and overshoot :data:`OIDC_LOGIN_ATTEMPT_CAP`. It is the
#: TWO-argument ``pg_advisory_xact_lock(int4, int4)`` form, whose lock space is
#: separate from the one-argument bigint space used elsewhere (including the
#: test-only write gates); the class is the issue number (#2908), matching the
#: convention of ``routers/state.py``. One table-wide lock, not a per-row key:
#: the cap is a single global count. Held only until the transaction ends.

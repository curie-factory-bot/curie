"""Review gate for the dark factory: the two reviewer loops, enforced in code.

The main loop runs on a model that does not reliably follow the review
protocol. It drops ``subagent_type`` (so a "review" silently runs as a
general-purpose agent on the main model), adds ``isolation: worktree`` (which
the sandbox refuses), and omits ``run_in_background`` (which CLI 2.1.280
treats as a background launch that stalls the turn). It also forgets to report
phases and rounds. This hook takes all of that out of the model's hands.

One script handles every hook event the bundle registers:

``PreToolUse`` on ``Bash``
    Refuses background shell commands. Run the command in the foreground and
    wait for its result before continuing or ending the turn.

``PreToolUse`` on ``Agent``/``Task``
    Only ``plan-reviewer`` and ``diff-reviewer`` may run. The type is kept when
    it names a reviewer, otherwise inferred from the description and prompt.
    ``isolation`` and ``model`` are stripped and ``run_in_background`` is forced
    to ``false``. The call is refused out of order: no diff review before the
    plan is approved, and no plan review after it (a diff rejection returns to
    implement, not to plan). The hook numbers the round itself and writes the
    ``plan_review`` or ``review_diff`` phase line to the pod log.

``PostToolUse`` / ``PostToolUseFailure`` on ``Agent``/``Task``
    Reads the reviewer's ``REVIEWER:`` and ``VERDICT:`` lines. A reply without
    them, or a call that errored, fails the run. ``VERDICT: CHANGES`` on round
    ``MAX_ROUNDS`` caps the loop.

``PreToolUse`` on ``publish_changes``
    Allowed only after the diff reviewer approved, and never after a failed or
    capped review.

``UserPromptSubmit``
    A new message starts a new run: the state resets.

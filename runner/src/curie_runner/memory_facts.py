"""Agent and channel memory facts (#1461, ADR-0167).

Two memories, each a namespace on the durable state API reached with the broad
``CURIE_MEMORY_TOKEN``:

- agent memory at ``CURIE_MEMORY_REF`` (``.../agents/<id>/state/memory``), loaded
  in every channel the agent works in;
- channel memory at ``CURIE_CHANNEL_MEMORY_REF``
  (``.../agents/<id>/state/bindings/<kind>/<address>/memory``), kept for one
  channel binding only.

A fact is one key ``fact-<32 hex>`` whose value is
``{"statement", "author", "stated_at", "session_id"}``. Agent memory also holds
two reserved keys that are never facts: ``log`` (the legacy append-only record
list that ``memory.py`` still loads) and ``guidance`` (``{"text": ...}``, the
operator's replacement for ``DEFAULT_GUIDANCE``).

The model writes facts through three tools on the platform ``curie`` server:
``remember``, ``update`` and ``forget`` (built in ``approval.py``, which owns
that server; this module stays free of the harness SDK). The runner mounts them only when the
worker set a channel memory ref, which it does only when an operator turned
memory writes on for the agent. The author of a fact is the person who sent the
turn's message, never a model-supplied value.

Memory guidance

You have two memories. Channel memory is kept for this channel only. Agent memory is loaded in every channel you work in.

Channel memory: remember things said here that should still hold next time.
- How to work here: instructions about how you should do your work ("Reply in threads.").
- Decisions: something decided that should hold going forward, with the reason ("We're dropping the weekly report; nobody reads it.").
- Who owns what: responsibilities, stated as roles ("Sam approves vendor contracts.").
- Where things are: pointers to documents, systems, trackers and locations ("The Q3 plan is in the shared drive under Planning.").

Don't remember descriptions of people beyond their role, data and figures that belong in their own system, or secrets.

Agent memory: don't save anything here.

Nothing is kept for later unless a remember or update call succeeds in this turn. When someone asks you to remember something, make it stick, or set a standing instruction, call remember. Never say you saved, noted or will remember something unless that call succeeded. If it was refused or failed, say so.

Use remember for a new fact, update to change a fact by its id, and forget to remove one. Save one fact per call."""  # noqa: E501

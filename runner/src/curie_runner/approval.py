"""Approval gates in the runner: the policy-gate tool and the permission gate.

ADR-0010 (approval gates, epic #22) defines one approval primitive with two
trigger types, and this module is the runner half of both:

- **Policy gate** (#244): the agent's own logic decides something needs a
  human decision. An in-process SDK MCP tool
  (``mcp__curie__request_approval``) is carried when a route is
  ``grantableViaPolicy``, or when the live MCP surface has a potentially
  mutating tool and no permission gate already pages. A fully observed
  surface whose tools all declare ``readOnlyHint=true`` omits it, so a model
  cannot page a human for an action the session cannot perform. Mounting it
  beside a permission gate produces a second card for one gated action
  (#2657). The call executes no real-world action; it only marks the turn,
  and the session emits its terminal ``final`` with ``status=awaiting-approval``.
- **Permission gate** (#245): configuration marks a tool as
  approval-required, and the runner intercepts the model-initiated call
  proactively through the SDK ``can_use_tool`` callback -- the replacement
  for the previously hardcoded ``permission_mode="bypassPermissions"``. The
  gated call is denied (never executed), the ``ApprovalGate`` records what
  was blocked, and the turn ends ``awaiting-approval`` exactly like a policy
  gate, so the durable-record/suspend/resume lifecycle (#244) is shared.

The durable ``Approval`` record, the authorizer, and the resume trigger all
live server-side with the worker/API (they must not be spoofable from inside
the sandbox -- see docs/interfaces/approval/INTERFACE.md); the runner's only
job is to end the turn in the awaiting-approval state.

Policy-gate detection is wire-level, not execution-level: ``translate.py``
captures the ``ToolUseBlock`` naming the request tool, so the fake-model path
(a scripted ``ToolUseBlock``, no tool execution, no network) exercises the
identical seam as a real model call.

# Best-effort only (#712): NOT authoritative, NOT used for any gating
# decision -- only to decide whether a bare operator gate name is worth a
# "did you mean mcp__<server>__<tool>?" warning. The SDK does not export an
# enumerable built-in tool list, and this set may drift from a future SDK
# version; a name missing from here is not an error, just an unwarned pass,
# and a name present here that isn't actually offered in a given session is
# similarly harmless (it just arms nothing, same as today).
#
# Provenance (#736): the names below are read out of the CLI the SDK actually
# ships, not guessed. runner/pyproject.toml pins claude-agent-sdk>=0.2.115; that
# version bundles Claude Code CLI 2.1.206 (claude_agent_sdk/_cli_version.py),
# binary at claude_agent_sdk/_bundled/claude. Two reproducible sources:
#
# 1. Tool-name string constants. Note the extraction pattern must NOT anchor on
#    "var ": the minified bundle chains declarators, e.g.
#    var gH="CronCreate",gU="CronDelete",CVt="CronList" , so a var-anchored
#    regex captures only the first name and silently drops its siblings (that
#    is how CronDelete/CronList went missing on the first pass). Use:
#      grep -ao '[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z_$0-9]*="[A-Z][A-Za-z]*"[,;]' <binary> \
#        | sed 's/.*="//;s/"[,;]//' | sort -u
# 2. The alias-to-canonical map, reproducible with:
#      grep -ao '.\{300\}BashOutputTool:"TaskOutput".\{0,400\}' <binary>
#    which yields verbatim:
#      {Task:"Agent",KillShell:"TaskStop",KillBash:"TaskStop",
#       AgentOutputTool:"TaskOutput",BashOutputTool:"TaskOutput",
#       AgentOutput:"TaskOutput",BashOutput:"TaskOutput",
#       ListPeers:"ListAgents",Brief:"SendUserMessage",
#       ListMcpResources:"ListMcpResourcesTool",
#       ReadMcpResource:"ReadMcpResourceTool",
#       ReadMcpResourceDir:"ReadMcpResourceDirTool"}
#
# The bound: this set holds ONLY names the SDK ``can_use_tool`` callback can
# actually observe, which is the CANONICAL tool-name set. It is deliberately NOT
# the CLI's whole recognition surface, because the two differ on alias keys.
#
# Why the alias map above is EXCLUDED rather than included. The bundled CLI
# consumes that map through a resolver, ``R2(e){return Object.hasOwn(Hti,e)?
# Hti[e]:e}``, and calls it only from its permission-RULE string parser
# (``{toolName:R2(e)}``) -- the settings.json allow/deny path. Curie's operator
# approval gate does not go through that path at all: ``build_approval_gate``
# arms names verbatim into ``gate.required`` and ``build_can_use_tool`` compares
# the SDK-reported tool name by exact equality, and the SDK reports the CANONICAL
# name. So an operator gating an alias (``ListMcpResources``, canonical
# ``ListMcpResourcesTool``) arms a literal that never matches: the gate silently
# arms nothing. For this gate an alias name IS a probable no-op, so its warning
# is a TRUE positive, not the false positive #736 set out to fix, and suppressing
# it would be exactly the silent fail-open #712 built the warning to surface.
# ``Task``, ``BashOutput``, and ``KillShell`` were in the historical pre-#736 set
# and are dropped for this reason (they are alias keys for ``Agent``,
# ``TaskOutput``, and ``TaskStop``); the canonical names stay.
#
# The inclusion criterion (apply this, do not re-derive it). A name is included
# when the bundled CLI does either of:
#   (a) declares it as a tool-name string constant AND carries a tool marker
#       next to it: a tool description string, a userFacingName(), or an
#       aliases:[...] registry entry, AND it is the canonical name rather than an
#       alias key from the map above; or
#   (b) still recognizes it in a permission-matcher list (the MultiEdit /
#       NotebookRead case).
# A bare capitalized string constant with no tool marker does NOT qualify, and an
# alias key NEVER qualifies.
#
# Recorded exclusions, so the raw-sweep diff is pre-resolved:
#   SlashCommand      zero occurrences of the literal in the binary.
#   TestingPermission real registry entry, but isEnabled(){return!1}, so it is
#                     never offered.
#   ConnectGitHub     name constant with no tool marker next to it, fails (a).
#   everything else the raw sweep returns (error classes, HTTP verbs,
#   credential types, Zod types, syntax-highlighter language names) fails (a).
#
# MultiEdit and NotebookRead are retained without a registry entry in 2.1.206:
# they have no tool description or name constant, but the CLI's live permission
# matcher still lists them (filePatternTools includes NotebookRead, and the
# write-tool deny set includes MultiEdit), so they remain legacy names the CLI
# recognizes in permission rules and gating them is not an operator mistake.

# Curie's own platform-owned MCP servers are ``curie`` and ``curie-state``

# plugin_format's ``connectors.RESERVED_CONNECTOR_NAMES`` refuses the names at
# deploy, so a bundle can never express a toolPolicy over them. ADR-0139 settles
# what that means -- bundle configuration may add restrictions but may not
# hollow out operator or platform controls -- so the tools these servers publish
# are outside toolPolicy scope entirely rather than classified against a policy
# they cannot appear in.
#
# There is deliberately NO server-set constant here. RESERVED_CONNECTOR_NAMES is
# the one list of these names (runner depends on plugin_format and never the
# reverse), and a mirror of it in this module would be a second copy that only a
# test ever read. The runtime exemption is decided on exact live TOOL names, not
# on a server set: see ``is_platform_owned_tool``, which is where the first
# #2286 fix went wrong by matching the server prefix instead.

# The live tool names the ``curie`` server publishes, enumerated from the two
# constants that already own them rather than respelled: ``APPROVAL_TOOL_NAME``
# is built from ``_TOOL_NAME`` above and ``PLATFORM_PUBLISH_TOOL_NAME`` is
# plugin_format's, which is also the literal the worker recognizes. Spelling
# either again here is the #453/#1495 drift trap: a second copy can stop
# matching the name the SDK actually puts on the wire, and the exemption would
# then silently arm nothing (or, worse, arm something else).
#
# Both are always exempt even though ``request_approval`` is omitted when a
# permission gate already pages (#2657): an omitted tool is not callable, so
# exempting its name costs nothing, and making the exemption depend on the
# pager decision would add a second way for the two to disagree. The same
# reasoning covers ``report_progress`` (#3077), mounted only for a factory
# execution: it reports a phase and never acts, so it is never gated. So does
# ``get_issue`` (ADR 0187): it reads only the execution's own issue.

class ApprovalGate:
    """Shared state between the ``can_use_tool`` callback and the session loop.

    ``required`` is the per-agent set of approval-required tool names: the
    union of the bundle manifest's ``approvalPolicy`` gates (#247, versioned
    with the agent) and the CURIE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED_TOOLS env override.
    ``route_by_tool`` maps a manifest-gated tool to its declared route name,
    so a blocked call carries the route the platform binds to a channel.
    ``pending_summary``/``pending_route`` are set by the callback when it
    blocks a call and consumed by the session at turn end to flip the final
    to awaiting-approval; ``reset()`` clears them at each turn start so one
    turn's block never leaks into the next. ``pending_halt`` records that the
    runner's own gate asked the CLI to stop the turn (#1852) -- it is
    runner-internal state, never a wire field, and the session reads it to tell
    "the turn ended badly because we stopped it for approval" apart from "the
    turn ended badly".

    The first blocked call of a turn wins: a model that retries the denied
    tool (against the deny message's instruction) does not overwrite the
    summary the human will resolve against.

    ``grant_tool`` is the one-shot post-approval allowance (#430, ADR-0035): the
    single tool name the worker injects from durable state at resume boot so a
    genuinely-approved permission-gate call completes exactly once.
    ``consume_grant`` spends it (one use, tool-name-scoped), and ``reset()``
    expires any unspent grant after the boot turn. The grant is deliberately
    boot-turn-only so it never leaks across turns: ``reset()`` runs at the start
    of every turn, so the FIRST reset (the boot turn) preserves a freshly
    injected grant and every later reset clears it.

    ``grantable_by_route`` is the #558 operator-opt-in map: for a manifest gate
    marked ``grantableViaPolicy``, it binds the gate's route to the MANIFEST tool
    that a policy approval on that route may grant. The session stamps
    ``approval_granted_tool`` from ``grantable_tool_for_route`` at turn end, so
    the granted tool comes from the manifest, never a model-supplied string; a
    route absent from this map resolves to None, preserving #544's no-grant
    default.

    EXACT membership in ``platform_tool_names``, and the exactness is the whole

    ``mcp__<platform server>__`` PREFIX, which also answers yes for every tool
    of a DIFFERENT server whose key merely begins ``curie__`` or
    ``curie-state__``: ``mcp__curie__extra__foo`` and
    ``mcp__curie-state__extra__bar`` both matched, and both were handed a bundle
    toolPolicy bypass. It was reachable while ``adapter.build_options`` left
    ``strict_mcp_config`` off: the CLI then loaded project ``.mcp.json``, user
    settings and plugin servers BESIDE the ``--mcp-config`` dict, and a mounted
    workspace is the session cwd, writable, and survives across sandboxes, so a
    ``.mcp.json`` sitting there was bundle-influenced input. A connector cannot
    do it (a connector name may not contain ``_``), an ambient project server
    could.

    The residual the exact match alone cannot close: when the platform HAS
    mounted a server, an impostor publishing a name-identical tool is exempt
    too, because the live name is the entire thing this gate sees. #2899 closes
    it one layer down: the runner now sets ``strict_mcp_config``, so no server
    outside the ``--mcp-config`` dict the runner builds can load, and this exact
    match stays as defence in depth. The
    class this closes is the one the prefix match invented: every name on a
    platform-shaped prefix that the platform does not itself publish.

    A bare ``mcp__curie__`` names no tool and is in no set, so it falls through
    to the fail-closed default, as does a bundle's own plugin-mounted server
    named ``curie`` (its live names carry the ``plugin_<bundle>_`` infix).

    permission rule already allows the call, and a skill's ``allowed-tools``
    frontmatter is such a rule -- so a bundle could arm a gate and then walk
    straight through it. The SDK names the fix on that very field: "To observe
    or gate *every* tool call regardless of permission rules, use a
    ``PreToolUse`` hook via ``hooks`` instead"
    (``claude_agent_sdk/types.py:1945-1947``). ``matcher=None`` matches every
    tool call, which is the whole claim.

    Returns the ``{"PreToolUse": [HookMatcher]}`` mapping ``__main__`` MERGES
    into the bundle's own hooks (#272). Note that the CLI dispatches every
    matcher on one event **concurrently** (``types.py:1956-1961``), so this hook
    must not assume it runs before a bundle's hook, and its position in the
    merged list is construction order, not precedence.

    Three outcomes, keyed on gate membership:

    - **Ungated tool** -> ``{}``. No decision, so the call falls through the
      CLI's normal precedence and on to ``can_use_tool``, preserving today's
      posture exactly. An ``allow`` here would silently widen authority for
      every non-gated tool AND skip the callback the policy lane (#544/#558)
      still relies on.
    - **Gated, with the one-shot grant available** -> an EXPLICIT ``allow``,
      after spending the grant here. This is load-bearing, not stylistic: the
      SDK documents (and it was observed live on 2026-08-29 against OpenRouter
      anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5) that a hook ``allow`` also skips
      ``can_use_tool``. So the hook must be the thing that spends the grant --
      if it returned ``{}`` instead, ``can_use_tool`` would run, find the grant
      unspent, and either block the approved call or (if the hook had spent it
      and still returned ``{}``) let one approval buy unlimited executions.
      Either way #430's one-shot allowance breaks. Do not "simplify" this to a
      bare ``{}``.
    - **Gated, no grant** -> record the block and ``deny``, plus the
      turn-stopping control fields, so the run pauses rather than spinning.

    A bundle's own PreToolUse guardrail can still veto an approved call
    (#1852, accepted rather than fixed). The grant above is spent AT DECISION
    TIME -- before this hook returns -- but every matcher on one ``PreToolUse``
    event is dispatched CONCURRENTLY by the CLI (``claude_agent_sdk/types.py``,
    the ``ClaudeAgentOptions.hooks`` docstring), so a bundle's own hook for the
    same tool (see ``hooks.py``) resolves independently and can return
    ``deny`` even though this hook already returned ``allow`` and spent the
    grant. When that happens the approved call does not execute, but the
    one-shot grant is already gone, so recovery is a fresh approval -- there is
    no way to detect a concurrently-dispatched hook's outcome from inside this
    callback, so this cannot be fixed from here. This is deliberate defense in
    depth, not a bug: a bundle's own guardrail vetoing an approved call is a
    legitimate second opinion, and failing toward "did not run, needs
    re-approval" is the safe direction -- the alternative (letting a
    bundle-denied call through because it was separately approved) would be a
    real hole. ``consume_grant`` is called here anyway (see the WARNING log at
    the call site) precisely because NOT spending it would let ``can_use_tool``
    re-block the approved call, which is the #430 regression this explicit
    ``allow`` exists to prevent.

    A gate's ``gate`` field names the tool the runner intercepts (the tool

    route the platform binds to a channel per deployment. Declared in the
    bundle so the policy is versioned and evaluable with the agent (#247);
    validated at deploy by ``plugin_format.validate_bundle``.

    **Enforcement intent is read from the DECLARED policy, never from the
    resolved map** (#520). The resolved map empties on a resolution error, so
    deciding "must I enforce?" from it fails OPEN exactly when parsing broke:
    ``__main__`` builds no gate at all from an empty map, restoring the
    hardcoded bypass. This reader therefore raises ``ApprovalPolicyError``
    once a policy is declared but cannot be armed as declared, and reserves
    the empty resolution for the honest cases: no dir, no manifest, no
    ``approvalPolicy``, or an explicitly empty ``gates`` list.

    Unlike the hooks/systemPrompt readers this one is NOT best-effort. Those
    degrade to a smaller capability set and ``load_plugins`` is a sufficient
    backstop; this one degrades to a wider authority set, and ``load_plugins``
    does not run on the fake tier at all (``__main__.factory`` returns first),
    so the backstop is absent precisely where it would be needed.

    The grantable map (#558) is computed from the SAME normalization the deploy
    validator uses (``plugin_format.grantable_routes``), so validator and loader
    agree on which routes are grantable by construction (#453). The loader
    IGNORES the ambiguous set as defense in depth: it arms no ambiguous grant but
    does NOT raise on it -- the ambiguous gates still arm their tools, so the
    policy is armable, and the deploy validator already rejects the ambiguity.

    bundle manifest's ``approvalPolicy`` (versioned with the agent, each gate

    **The bundle may only ADD names, never remove an operator-set one** (#520,

    update, an override, a bundle-wins precedence) would silently break it.

    The residual surface the union does NOT close is which ROUTE governs a tool
    both sources name: the operator's list carries no routes, so the bundle's
    route rides an operator-gated name and picks the approving audience. It is
    bounded -- the bundle can only name routes the operator has itself bound to
    a channel in ``approval_routes``, and ADR-0046 refuses an unbound one
    outright -- so the tool stays gated and the audience stays operator-chosen.
    We log it rather than refusing: making it fatal is disproportionate to a
    bounded widening, and `curie <tier> approvals` reports the two sources as
    one unlabeled list while `--gate` writes a full replacement, so echoing the
    displayed set back is the documented way to CREATE this overlap. A boot
    raise would crash-loop that flow, and would strand an approved action whose

    Direct equality answers the built-in case (``Bash`` gated, ``Bash`` allowed).
    It does NOT answer the MCP case, and that gap is a fail-open rather than a
    cosmetic one: ``build_approval_gate`` arms an MCP gate under its live name
    (``mcp__plugin_<bundle>_<server>__<tool>``), while a skill author writes the
    natural ``mcp__<server>__<tool>`` shorthand. Compared raw, those two strings
    never match and the conflict is missed entirely.

    So a non-matching entry is run through ``effective_operator_gates`` -- the SAME
    normalization ``build_approval_gate`` applies to an operator's shorthand -- and
    the result is intersected with the armed set. Reusing that function rather than
    writing a second shorthand parser is deliberate: two parsers for one naming

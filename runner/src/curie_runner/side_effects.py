"""Classify a tool call as idempotent (safe) or side-effecting.

The ACI ``side_effect_flag`` gates the no-retry-after-side-effects rule (ACI
section 2b): a failed run that executed a non-idempotent tool escalates to a
human instead of retrying, because at-least-once delivery plus a mutating tool
means a blind retry risks a duplicate real-world action.

Design choice (documented for F1/K1): a **read-only allowlist**, deny-by-default.
A harness declares which of its tools only read state; every other tool the
harness executes is treated as potentially side-effecting and flags the run.
This fails safe: a new or unknown tool escalates rather than being silently
retried. The alternative, an explicit non-idempotent denylist, fails open (a new
mutating tool would be missed) and was rejected for that reason.

**The read-only set is harness-declared** (ADR-0060). Tool identifiers are
harness-specific: the Claude Code harness names its read-only tools in PascalCase
(``Read``, ``Grep``, ...), while a second harness such as OpenCode names the same
capabilities in lowercase (``read``, ``grep``, ``webfetch``). The classifier
itself stays harness-agnostic and deny-by-default; it is constructed with the
active harness's declared read-only set. The default is the Claude adapter's
declaration (``CLAUDE_READONLY_TOOLS``), so an unconfigured caller sees the
historical Claude behavior unchanged. A future OpenCode adapter constructs the
classifier with its own declaration instead. There is no env knob for this: the
env override that once advertised itself here was never wired to a consumer, and
an unwired widening knob on a deny-by-default classifier is worse than none -- it
reads as an escape hatch that silently does nothing (#488).

# EVERY harness: it executes no real-world action (it only marks the turn
# awaiting-approval), and when applicable it is injected by the platform rather
# than shipped by the harness. It is therefore always treated as idempotent,
# independent of which harness's read-only declaration is in force -- flagging it
# would block the no-retry rule for the very turns approvals pause, and a harness
# declaration that happened to omit it must not be able to reintroduce that bug.
# The factory's ``report_progress`` (#3077) is idempotent for the same reason: it
# reports a phase to the status card and acts on nothing (#3464). The factory's
# ``get_issue`` (ADR 0187) only reads the execution's own issue.

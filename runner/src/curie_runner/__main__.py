    a typo degrades to the default rather than failing boot), which is why the

    stored (#2927). A write since that load conflicts, and the next pass reloads
    instead of writing a stale view over it; there are at most three passes.

    A compaction that still cannot fit (or three passes that never settle) is
    the one exception to fatal (#2820): no cold sandbox can fix that thread, so

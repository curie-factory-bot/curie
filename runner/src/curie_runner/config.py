"""Runner configuration: the declared BootEnv, read back as the runner's view.

``BootEnv`` (from ``aci-protocol``) is the single declaration of the worker-to-
runner boot env: the frozen ACI ``SessionConfig`` plus the platform-operational
vars. ``RunnerConfig`` is the runner-local shape the boot path consumes, built
from that one parse rather than from its own ``CURIE_*`` reads -- every name
this lane needs is declared once, in the contract, so a rename cannot leave the
sandbox booting fine with a silently dropped feature (#488, ADR-0049).

The parse tolerance is deliberately non-uniform and lives in ``BootEnv``: the
turn cap and the port raise on garbage, the history-window knobs degrade to
their default. Each var keeps the behavior it has.

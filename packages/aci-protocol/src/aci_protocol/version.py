"""The ACI protocol version and its semver compatibility policy.

This is the single source of truth for the wire version embedded in every
outbound event and in the exported JSON Schema. The ACI is versioned as semver,
independent of the Curie release: the number tracks the wire contract's
compatibility, not the product's cadence.

The compatibility rule a consumer applies is same ``major.minor`` under 0.x
(same ``major`` from 1.0 on). A new optional field is a patch (tolerant
consumers ignore it); every breaking change (new required field, new enum value,
removal, rename, type change) bumps the minor under 0.x. See ``packages/CLAUDE.md``
for the change-class table and ``docs/adr/0036-*`` for the rationale.

``WIRE_VERSION_FIELD`` names the wire field carrying the version. The exporters
special-case it by name (required, semver-constrained, version-guarded) rather
than introspecting a type, so removing the old ``Literal`` does not silently gut
the guard.

# same thing in Python and in the ECMA-262 ``pattern`` emitted into the JSON
# Schema, where the Rust lane parses ASCII-only. The ``^...$`` anchors stay

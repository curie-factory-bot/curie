"""Session setup: the typed SessionConfig, the BootEnv superset, and their env
(de)serialization.

``SessionConfig`` mirrors the ACI contract v0.1 SESSION SETUP block (section 0).
A session is configured through environment variables and mounted files;
SessionConfig is the typed view of those variables, with helpers to render them
to and parse them from a process environment.

Env mapping:
    CURIE_PLUGIN_DIR     -> plugin_dir
    CURIE_MEMORY_REF     -> memory_ref        (optional)
    CURIE_CREDENTIALS    -> credentials_ref   (optional)
    CURIE_SESSION_ID     -> session_id
    CURIE_SANDBOX_ID     -> sandbox_id
    CURIE_BUDGET         -> budget            (JSON object)
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*   -> otel              (endpoint / headers / protocol)

``BootEnv`` (#488, ADR-0049) is the Curie-platform superset: SessionConfig
COMPOSED as a field plus the platform-operational boot vars (runner token,
bundle ref, approval plumbing, history port, model routing, the operator knobs).
It is deliberately not an extension of SessionConfig -- see ADR-0049 and the
class docstring.

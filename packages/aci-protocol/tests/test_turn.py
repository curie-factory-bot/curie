"""Reader-context propagation into nested models on the queued-turn payload,
and ``ReplyHandle``'s routing half (ADR-0096 phase 2, D1/D2).

``QueuedTurn`` crosses the Valkey Stream boundary between the dispatcher and the
worker, carrying a nested ``ReplyHandle``. The tolerant-read policy must reach
that nested model, not just the top-level one -- pydantic propagates validation
context into nested models, but decision 1 says assert it, do not assume it.

``ReplyHandle.kind`` is REQUIRED (plan section 1, D1): an optional kind forces
the resolver to answer "what do I do when kind is None?", and every honest answer
is an address-only fallback or a ``"slack"`` default -- #38's silent misroute
re-opened at the exact point the field that prevents it finally exists.
``ReplyHandle.adapter`` is optional at the schema (a third-party producer is not
rejected outright) but every first-party mint site sets it explicitly; the mint
sites are asserted by T-A17 (dispatcher), T-A18 (resume) and T-C2 (ingress).
